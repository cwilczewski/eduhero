                <p>John Silva was my daughter's tutor for Grade 10 math, getting her through the final half of the year with a dramatic improvement in marks that had been trending toward failure. But more importantly, he was one of the few math tutors to actually get through to her, explaining the concepts in a way that a girl who does not take naturally to math could understand. John got her over the fear of numbers and into a comfort zone that stood her well in Grade 11, where she did not need a math tutor. For this, we will always be thankful and have recommended John to other parents whose kids need effective, enjoyable help to ease the pressure and make success possible. It was always a pleasure to have John around.  </p>

                <p>Our daughter had John as weekly math tutor in grades 9 and 10 and briefly in 11 (2012 – 2014). Her math teacher referred us to his employer after frustrations in grade 9 math became apparent.  During this time our daughter Frances went from struggling and not confident in math to more confident and more self-reliant to the point of not needing a tutor in grade 11. Her grades immediately improved from C’s to B’s. Math is not her thing and he helped her get through it. </p>

                <p>John is fully comfortable with math and teaching it to others, and is able to make a stressed-out student gain confidence and do better.  Words Frances and I use to describe John’s math tutoring include patient, kind, thorough, available (let her know she could reach out any time) and caring.  He took the time to explain, and he created practice work tailored to our daughter’s needs.  He always checked to confirm understanding, and did not move on without ensuring understanding.</p>

## Overview

John Silva a local tutor, was looking for a professional looking website to replace his previous old site. While the old site was still up to standards, the style of it was out of date and didn’t match his likings anymore. After consulting with Mr. Silva several times we decided on a layout that would allow for users to view almost all the information they needed to know on the main page, including a quick way to get in contact with him. The other pages simply act as extra detail in case a user would like to learn more.

The layout also made use of a “Contact Us” button, right as you load the site, which makes it even easier if someone simply wants to book a session, and ask a question. The color scheme of white, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, was chosen since the colors work perfectly with each other, and matched the criteria of looking professional as the client wanted. Over all the client was very pleased with the site and has started to receive more business than previously did.
